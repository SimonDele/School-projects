# School-projects

List of some interesting projects completed while being at INSA Rouen Normandie in **Applied Mathematics** department.

## 2019 - Final year

* **Inpainting** with a Deep Learning approach following a Nvidia paper by G. Liu in 2018 [
Image Inpainting for Irregular Holes Using Partial Convolutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07723). <br> <p align="center"> <img src="/Final-year/Inpainting/res.png" height="300" /> </p>

* Introduction to **constraints and logical programming** using *Prolog*. In this course, with my colleague, we implemented 1) a near brute force approach, 2) a **backtracking** algorithm, 3) a constraint approach with a finite **automaton** on a Picross Grid (a more complex Sudoku variant).

* **Multi-agents system** course : *modelisation and simulation* of severe desease expansion in a city using [Gama Platform](https://gama-platform.github.io/). [[report]](https://github.com/SimonDele/School-projects/Final-year/SMA_TP_GAML.pdf). Bibliography work on use of **Reinforcement Learning** in Multi-Agents Systems [[report]](/Final-year/Multi_Agents_System/SMA_Reinforcement_Learning_Rapport_Bibliographique.pdf)

* **Virtual Reality** course : development of an *immersive* game with the *Unity engine* and *C#* with 2 other teammates. The game simulates a plane dives, where the player needs to control a parachutist in order to land on a target. [[report]](/Fourth-year/RV_Rapport.pdf)

* **Data Science** course : Titanic competion in Kaggle, [[kernel]](https://www.kaggle.com/sdelecourt/randomforest-grid-search-fine-tuning-cv). 

## 2018 - Fourth year

* Implementation of a **Genetic Algorithm** and a simple **Neural Network** to play a game called Flappy Bird (re-implemented) in *Java*. [[repository]](https://github.com/SimonDele/Flappy-Bird-proj-sem), [[report]](/Fourth-year/Flappy_Bird_IA.pdf). <br> <p align="center"> <img src="/Fourth-year/Flappy_Whale/flappy_whale.png" width="300"/> </p>
  

* C++ [[report]](https://github.com/SimonDele/School-projects/Fourth-year/Rapport_C%2B%2B.pdf)

* Canv'Us [[report]](https://github.com/SimonDele/School-projects/Fourth-year/Toile_Collaborative.pdf)
