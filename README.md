# School-projects

List of some interesting projects completed while being at INSA Rouen Normandie in **Applied Mathematics** department.

## 2019 - Final year

* **Inpainting** with a Deep Learning approach following a Nvidia paper by G. Liu in 2018 [
Image Inpainting for Irregular Holes Using Partial Convolutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07723) 

* Introduction to **constraints and logical programming** using *Prolog*. In this course, with my colleague, we implemented 1) a near brute force approach, 2) a **backtracking** algorithm, 3) a constraint approach with a finite **automaton** on a Picross Grid (a more complex Sudoku variant).

* **Multi-agents system** course : *modelisation and simulation* of severe desease expansion in a city using [Gama Platform](https://gama-platform.github.io/)

* **Virtual Reality** course : development of an *immersive* game with the *Unity engine* and *C#* with 2 other teammates. The game simulates a plane dives, where the player needs to control a parachutist in order to land on a target.    

* **Data Science** course : Titanic competion in Kaggle, kernel available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sdelecourt/randomforest-grid-search-fine-tuning-cv)

## 2018 - Fourth year

* Implementation of a **Genetic Algorithm** and a simple **Neural Network** to play a game called Flappy Bird (re-implemented) in *Java*. To see the repo click [here](https://github.com/SimonDele/Flappy-Bird-proj-sem). 

* C++

* CanvUs
